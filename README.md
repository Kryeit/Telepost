**Mod description**

Telepost doesn't require any other mod to function. However, it has softdepend functions for:
- [GriefDefender](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1-12-2-1-20-4-griefdefender-claim-plugin-grief-prevention-protection.68900/): to claim the posts when using /buildposts and also let players name a post if they have enough claim blocks.
- [WorldEdit](https://modrinth.com/plugin/worldedit): when using /buildposts, the terrain will be accommodated in order for the post to look good.
- [Bluemap](https://modrinth.com/plugin/bluemap): when using /namepost, a marker with its name will appear

They will be explained further in the bottom of the page.

Telepost can build (if needed) posts throughout the whole map, one each 2000 blocks. These posts serve as a nerfed teleportation system. Players can only execute teleport commands in those specific locations of the world, making it fun to explore and meet up with other players!

- /nearestpost: Tells you where the nearest post is.
- /setpost: Sets a home on the nearest post.
- /homepost: Teleports you to your home.
- /invite <Player>: Invite a player to your home post.
- /visit <Player/NamedPost>: Teleports you to an invited post or to a Named Post
- /namepost <PostName> : gives a name to the nearest post. Only for admins.
- /unnamepost <PostName> : unnames a post. Only for admins.
- /buildposts: Builds all posts. Only for admins

How to use /buildpost: place in `world/generated/structures/minecraft` a `default.nbt`, then place any other .nbt with a biome name, such as `plains.nbt`. Posts will be built with that structure depending on the biome, if none found, the default will be used.

- telepost.admin : Helper + you can use tp-related commands everywhere in the Overworld.
- telepost.helper : lets you visit other's home posts without needing an invitation.

- /buildposts: It also creates a claim in each post, 3d claim and also adds it to a "Posts" claimgroup
- Users are also able to use /namepost once if they have more than 80.000 earned claimblocks, doesn't consume them. NO PERMISSION NEEDED

# Posts NBT's:

There is a nbt per biome, that includes Vanilla biomes and Terralith biomes.
In total there is 133 different post nbt's, plus a `default.nbt` that is a copy of `plains.nbt`.
Special thanks to the players involved on building them:
- __Tesseract
- OlimilO
- Antonovich
- Enzo
- Slayz

*Note: the post also include blocks from Create mod, Farmers Delight, so if you use those, it will look best, if not, feel free to modify the .nbt's*
